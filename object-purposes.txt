- It manages open files
- It interacts with File Paths Object to change the names of the filepaths depending on the experiment settings
- It creates, moves, and deletes files in the system

dependencies: (most passed in at constructor from ObjectManager)
- ExperimentSettings
- AITypes
- FilePathsObj
- BotAITypes
- ExperimentTypes
- FileNameElements (in same file)
